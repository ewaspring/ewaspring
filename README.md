# 👋 Hi, I’m Lovea Chino  

✨ Dreamer · Creator · Engineer of Harmony ✨  

- 🎶 I weave **Music** into algorithms, searching for resonance between sound and code.  
- 🖋️ I create **Languages & Systems**, from artistic DSLs to experimental frameworks.  
- 🎨 My canvas spans **Painting, Architecture, and Geometry**, exploring the hidden symmetries behind forms.  
- 💻 Skilled in **Java, Python, and Web Engineering**, but always seeking to transcend syntax into vision.  
- 🌌 Currently exploring **Mathematical Dimensional Languages** (like *Miohalo*) — geometric modules of thought, inspired by E8 and higher-order patterns.  
- 🤝 Open to collaboration with those who pursue **order within chaos** and **beauty within code**.
